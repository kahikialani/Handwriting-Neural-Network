# Neural Network to Read Handwriting
## Goal
The goal of this repo is:
- Develop a neural network to read handwritten text and characters.
- Develop an alogirthm to isolate text on a page for better allowance.
- Create a UI for users to upload images of their handwriting (non-cursive) and decode what it says.
- Create a production model that will create handwritten notes from input text.
